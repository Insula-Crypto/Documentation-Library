Our mission is to build on the concepts and infrastructure of Web 3.0:

## Insula from A to Z:

This guide introduces Insula Investment Management, its investment offering, and a detailed step by step guide to buy crypto, invest and track your investment performance.

This document takes Insula investors by the hand from A to Z, to allow Insula investors to be fully informed about Insula and its investment products offering.

## Insula is controlled and owned by its users:

Investing in Insula is a disintermediated, end to end process:
Insula is designed for autonomous crypto investors. 
Investors autonomously deposit their Ethereum directly in our funds, without even contacting or passing by Insula or its staff. 

Insula investors are empowered since they fully control their private keys, benefit from a high anonymity (GDPR compliant) and an ease of use.

## Insula investors’ crypto is stored on a blockchain vault:

The deposit and withdrawal process can only be controlled by the investor. 
Insula’s staff has no hands on the deposit and withdrawal processes and cannot interfere with it. 
In fact the funds invested by Insula's clients are locked in a smart contract. 

The smart contract acts as a trusted & secure third party holding the investors funds between Insula and the investor.

## Insula investors invest and withdraw 24/7 without any paperwork and delays:

Insula investors can invest & withdraw their funds 24/7 without any delay, procedure or paperwork, or working hours constraints. 
Insula investors funds are invested / withdrawn immediately without a lockup period or any downtime. 

Insula investors only need to press “invest/withdraw”, wherever, whenever they want, at the frequency they want, while remaining pseudonymous if they wish to. 

## Insula offers free and premium support to its new clients and existing investors:

We understand that some investors are relatively new to the Insula blockchain ecosystem and may need assistance. We are happy to help.

Insula Premium provides investors with  1) enterprise grade assistance (on technological matters)  2)  key account manager (on financial matters).

Insula managed accounts help streamline investment procedures while at the same time reducing costs for clients that prefer to be actively involved in the management of their assets.
